Condition for Explicit wait in selenium webdriver

#1- I have a web page which has some login form and after login,
it takes a lot of time to load Account page or Home page. This page is dynamic
it means sometimes it takes 10 seconds to load the homepage, sometimes its 15 second and so on.
In this situation, the Explicit wait can help us
which will wait until specific page/page title is not present it will keep waiting.



#2- You are working on travel application and you have filled the web form
and clicked on submit button. Now you have to wait until complete data is not loaded
or specific data is not loaded. In this case, again we can use Explicit wait
in which we can give wait till specific or set of elements are not loaded.

#3- There are some elements on a web page which are hidden and it will be displayed
only when specific conditions get true, so we have to wait until these elements are not visible.
In this case, again explicit wait will help in which we can specify wait
till the element or elements are not visible.

There are many situations in which your test script may run ahead of the website or application you're testing,
resulting in timeouts and a failing test. For example, you may have a dynamic content element that,
after a user clicks on it, a loading appears for five seconds. If your script isn't written in such a way
as to account for that five second load time, it may fail because the next interactive element isn't available yet.

The general advice from the Selenium community on how to handle this is to use explicit waits.
While you could also use implicit waits, an implicit wait only waits for the appearance of certain
elements on the page, while an explicit wait can be set to wait for broader conditions.
