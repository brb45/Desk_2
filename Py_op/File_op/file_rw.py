# doesn't read the whole file into memory, which solves the problem with files too big to fit in memory

# ijson will iteratively parse the json file instead of reading it all in at once. This is slower
# than directly reading the whole file in, but it enables us to work with large files that can’t fit in memory.
# To use ijson, we specify a file we want to extract data from, then we specify a key path to extract:

#
# with is the nice and efficient pythonic way to read large files. advantages:
# 1) file object is automatically closed after exiting from with execution block.
# 2) exception handling inside the with block.
# 3) memory for loop iterates through
# the f file object line by line. internally it does buffered IO (to optimized on costly IO operations) and memory management.

# windows打开文件默认是以“gbk“编码的，可能造成不识别unicode字符，于是做了如下的修改：
# Just add: encoding='utf-8'
