This package contains the python source files for flowGen instead of the executable
flowGen.exe.  It requires that python be installed on the machine.  Our recommendation
is to use Python version 2.5, 2.6, or 2.7.

To see some examples of running flowGen using the Python interpreter and the
flowGen python source code, look at the run_*.bat files in this package.
