# Looks good; our base method is only being called once.
#
# But what is super() actually doing here? Since the print
# statements are executed after the super calls, the printed output is in the order each method is actually executed.
# Let's look at the output from back to front to see who is calling what.
#
# First, call_me of Subclass calls super().call_me(), which happens to refer
# to LeftSubclass.call_me(). The LeftSubclass.call_me() method then calls super().call_me(),
# but in this case, super() is referring to RightSubclass.call_me().
#
# Pay particular attention to this: the super call is not calling the method on the superclass of
# LeftSubclass (which is BaseClass). Rather, it is calling RightSubclass, even though it is not a
# direct parent of LeftSubclass! This is the next method, not the parent method. RightSubclass then
# calls BaseClass and the super calls have ensured each method in the class hierarchy is executed once.
