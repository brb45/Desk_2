6.	Testing of IQfact+ new releases.  (75%)
7.	Correlation testing between exiting products and new products, including new testers, new methodology in terms of IQfact+ solution and etc. (10%)
8.	Verification and trouble-shooting of issues, reported from field, customers, both internally and externally, and etc.  (10%)
9.	Maintenance of QA test stations and set-up of new stations upon request. (4%)
10.	 Maintenance and development of automation and tools of log analysis and flow-generation. (1%)


System Test/QA intern:
1.	Create web-based QA test management system:
    a.	Real-time monitoring test status for each QA station.
2.	Manages database for each QA station: 
    "	History of tests and test data: Jira number, log location, 
    "	Setup information and DUT related information.
3.	Keep track of all QA related documentation/manuals.
4.	On-line bookkeeping of RF components, and tools in QA lab.
5.	The completion of the project will significantly boost productivity and efficiency of QA work. 
It will also provide a great and easy way for team to review and  manage QA resource.

./bin/IQXPCServices contains all compiled XPC Service binaries
./doc contains doxygen documentation
Doxyfile includes the documentation configuration for the project
./lib contains all library dependancies
./src contains all project and source code files
./etc contains all related configuration files for execution
./install contains project installer

ENVIRONMENT:

Since many dylibs depend on dependancies installed in ~/Documents/lp, to successfully run the
IQXPCHOST (IQXPCHost Shell) application, building and running the installer located in ./install
is required.
